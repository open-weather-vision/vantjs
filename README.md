vantjs is a platform-independent javascript and typescript interface to the Davis Vantage Pro, Pro 2 and Vue. It works on any linux, windows or osx device!

# Features

-   Getting **hourly, daily, monthly** and **yearly highs and lows** (read more [here](https://open-weather-vision.github.io/vantjs/classes/structures.HighsAndLows.html))

```ts
const highsAndLows = await station.getHighsAndLows();

console.log(
    `Todays minimum temperature was ${highsAndLows.tempOut.day.low} Â°F!`
);
// Output: Today's minimum temperature was 25.3 Â°F!

console.log(
    `The maximum rain rate in the current hour was ${highsAndLows.rainRate.hour} in/h!`
);
// Output: The maximum rain rate in the current hour was 0.2 in/h!
```

-   Getting **realtime weather data** (read more [here](https://open-weather-vision.github.io/vantjs/classes/structures.DetailedRealtimeData.html))

```ts
const realtime = await station.getDetailedRealtimeData();

console.log(`Currently it's ${realtime.tempOut} Â°F!`);
// Output: Currently it's 45.2 Â°F!

console.log(
    `The wind blows from ${realtime.windDir} with an average speed of ${realtime.windAvg10m} mph!`
);
// Output: The wind blows from SW with an average speed of 23.12 mph!
```

-   **Converting** the weather data automatically to the **desired units**

```ts
const station = await WeatherStation.connect({
    units: {
        temperature: "Â°C",
        wind: "km/h",
        rain: "mm",
        ...
    },
    ....
});

const realtime = await station.getDetailedRealtimeData();
console.log(`It's ${realtime.tempIn} Â°C`);
// Output: It's 23.1233 Â°C
```


-   **Stable connection** management: On disconnect vantjs repeatedly tries to reconnect in the background, your application won't crash!
