/**
 * The more feature rich version of the realtime data container providing {@link HighsAndLows} and {@link DetailedRealtimeData}.
 * Only works on Vantage Pro 2 and Vue (having firmware dated after April 24, 2002 / v1.90 or above).
 *
 * **What are realtime data containers?**
 *
 * Realtime data containers provide another level of abstraction to interact with your weather station. Instead of manually calling methods like
 * {@link WeatherStationAdvanced.getHighsAndLows} or {@link WeatherStationAdvanced.getDetailedRealtimeData}, you just access the attributes of an instance of this class.
 * E.g. to get the current outside temperature you just create a realtime interface and access it using `realtime.tempOut`.
 *
 * Internally this works via an update cycle. Every `container.settings.updateInterval` seconds the interface requests data from your weather station to update its attributes.
 * As the realtime interface is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter), you can listen to the `"update"` event. Additionally
 * there is the `"valid-update"` event which only fires if no error occurrs.
