/**
 * The smaller version of the realtime data container providing {@link HighsAndLows} and {@link SimpleRealtimeData}.
 * Works on Vantage Vue, Pro and Pro 2.
 *
 * **What are realtime data containers?**
 *
 * Realtime data containers provide another level of abstraction to interact with your weather station. Instead of manually calling methods like
 * {@link VantInterface.getHighsAndLows} or {@link VantInterface.getSimpleRealtimeData}, you just access the properties of an instance of this class.
 * E.g. to get the current outside temperature you just create a realtime data container and access it using `container.tempOut`.
 *
 * Internally this works via an update cycle. Every `container.settings.updateInterval` seconds the container uses an {@link VantInterface} to update its properties.
 * As the realtime data container is an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#class-eventemitter), you can listen to the `"update"` event. Additionally
 * there is the `"valid-update"` event which only fires if no error occurrs. To get an overview of all fired events take a look at {@link RealtimeDataContainerEvents}.
 *
 * Realtime data containers provide **another level of stability**. If the console disconnects from your computer the realtime data container stays alive waiting
 * for the console to reconnect.
